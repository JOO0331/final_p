Game just spawns enemies within 50-100 meters. Hope patches will make it work like in previous games, because without it it's not STALKER and the world is empty and lifeless without it.\n5. Enemies are just sponges for bullets. Need rebalance. 4 mags to kill a bloodsucker? Really?\nOther things to mention that I would like DEVs to change/add:\n- Day/night cycle is too short\n- No sleeping bags\n- It costs a fortune to repair weapons and suits\n- No dymanic shadows from the flashlight\n- eneimes just spam you with grenades all the time\n- would be cool to have more food/drinks options and cook monster parts like in GAMMA or order some meals in the bars\n- weapons/suits condition goes down waaaaay to fast (shot 2 mags from AK and got -3%. Whaaaaaat?)\n- when you sit at the campfire you cannot eat/drink/open PDA/inventory etc.\n- you get hungry every 5-10 minutes. I assume longer day/night cycle would be a great option as well to fix the issue.\n- mutants AI is strange. If you're being chased by the mutants and jump of the car for example they just run away. When you get down they appear again. They don't try to jump or at least swarm around the car waiting for their meal.\n\nFor now the game is medium rare. Waiting for the DEVs to cook it properly and then it will be the game of the year for sure.",

I'm so happy with my purchase of this game. \r\nSo far there are only 2 negatives:\r\nFirst: English voice acting is not great. Play this with the Ukrainian voice actors on, and just read the English Subtitles. \r\nSecond: You will have to spend a little bit of time tweaking your settings to get good fps, however once I did that I now get consistent 80-100 fps, even in the main town, with most of my settings turned to high/epic thanks to FSR upscaling/Frame generation, and the game feels very natural with these settings on using my 3070. \r\nTHERE WILL BE ALOT OF NEGATIVITY AROUND HOW THIS GAME RUNS THAT WILL RUIN ITS RATING. DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE REVIEWS, IT TOOK ME LITERALLY 15 MINS TO FIND SETTINGS THAT WORKED FLAWLESSLY FOR ME. \r\n\r\n",

        "review": "As a long time fan of the series, this sequel feels hollow. One of the defining features of the series was it's living world. NPC's would wander around, fight over territory, and have their own radio chatter about local events. That system is gone now, and replaced with a generic spawning system. \n\nAs an example, I cleared a camp of enemies, looted it, walked a few feet outside of it, and enemies immediately spawned back in, shooting at me. Another example, a friendly group spawned in, helped me fight a mutant, I turned away to open a stash, turned back around, and they were gone.\n\nThere also doesn't seem to be any faction relations, or even randomly generated jobs for other stalkers. The stealth in this game is a joke, with enemies being able to see you through walls and foliage with hawk-like perception, and once they do spot you, they will always know where you are even if you break line of sight. The game, like the older games, warns you to lower your weapon around other stalkers, except in this one, they don't actually care. Equipment wears out incredibly easy, and is very expensive to repair (at least in the early game). For example, I got in 2 gunfights and had to drop 2000 to fix up my gun. I wouldn't mind the repair costs if I was able to do missions for other stalkers for money or items.\n\nNone of this even touches on the bugs, granted, outside of crashes here and there, there hasn't been anything gamebreaking that i've ran into. Just a lot of npc's phasing through floors or levitating, and the combat AI performing some... questionable tactics. The optimization isn't great but it's UE5 so nobody is shocked. I got around 70 fps with some dips in large safe zones.\n\nI hope that one day this game lives up to it's name, but right now, it falls incredibly short in what made the series unique in the first place. Hopefully the issues with the game are fixable, either by mods or the devs making changes. But in it's current state, I can't recommend it.",

And it HAS to do those things well, or else it's just a shambling mess.\n...and where is A-Life 2.0? It was removed from the Steam page before release for 'marketing purposes' but it seems more and more now that they actually entirely gave up on implementing it in the first place.\nWhy is everything spawning on the other side of hills, or behind me when I'm not looking?\nWhy can I never encounter anyone who isn't within spitting distance that isn't inside a base?\nWhy are the mutants absolutely comical bullet sponges?\nWhy do all the enemies in an area instantly spot you the moment you silently kill one guy, if they haven't already magically spotted you and are laser-beaming you through foliage because crouching does little to nothing to conceal you?\nWhat's going on here?\nGet out of here, Stalker, and wait a few months for some patches, if those can even fix this game's fundamental Cyberpunk-level issues. 14 years, guys, I understand the invasion has happened, but if it was this bad and y'all decided to ship it anyways... come on.",

        "review": "This game is good, aside from one MASSIVE issue. And 1 smaller one. First the smaller one, weapon customization/ modding. In the first game there was a large branching tree of upgrades for each gun that would take awhile to max out. I maxed out my ak74s tiny upgrade tree in the first 2 hours in this game.  Also would have liked to see an expansive attachment system, but it's pretty bare bones. \n\nBut the real issue is unacceptable. A life 2.0 is a fat fucking lie. There is no life to this game. The ai is stupid as fuck and just spawns on you all the time, I feel like I'm playing farcry 5. They don't use cover or tactics, they just run at you and die. In the original stalkers the Ai would be wondering around living their lives fighting and camping out. You could spot a group of stalkers getting attacked by dogs 500m away, see only 1 survived and bump into that sole survivor 20 mins later chilling at a fire in a village. In this game the ai just randomly spawn and despawn around you. I don't think you could actually snipe in this game because of it. \n\nThe biggest joke I saw so far was I went to this small military camp. Killed a group of soldiers out from, went in and killed another group at the barracks. While I was looting the guys in the barracks it spawned another group right outside, they spotted me through the walls and bum rushed in to their deaths. This went on for like 7 respawned squads, I just kept stuffing all their loot in a duffle bag inside cause I couldn't hold it all. And they never stopped, 7 wasnt the end because they stopped spawning. It's because I got tired of farming them and left (under fire). And quite frankly it doesn't even seem like they tried to make the Ai good, or made an A-life 2.0. It looks like it was just a marketing gimmick. So I don't see this as a fixable issue, there's no foundation to improve upon.",

        "review": "My all time favorite has always been Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl. Of course, I’ve played Lost Alpha, who hasn’t? It’s basically mandatory for Stalker fans. And Misery? it’s not just a mod.. it’s a survival simulator that makes you masochist. Anomaly? Yeah, it doesn’t just merge the trilogy, it crams in so much extra content that even the Zone itself might say, “Okay buddy thats enough!” Believe me, I’ve been there. But nothing can compare to that magical moment in 2007 when I first installed the first Stalker game and heard that haunting main menu music. At the same time, I was also playing Condemned Criminal Origins and had developed this weird obsession with dark, heavy games that most sane people wouldn’t touch. (Thanks to Clive Barker's Undying, F.E.A.R., Call Of Cthulhu, Deus Ex, Silent Hill 2 and Manhunt for fueling my love for dark games)\r\nHonestly, I’ve never seen a Stalker game with good optimization in human history... and yes, Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl proudly carries on this sacred tradition. Whatever you do, don’t even think about starting the game without DLSS turned on.\r\nGiven the war situation, I was almost certain the game would feel incomplete. But so far, I haven’t come across any serious bugs or crashes. Come on, the game only crashed twice in 9 hours that's a solid ratio! By Stalker standards, that's practically a blessing. Old fans might initially feel that Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl is less like a next-gen Stalker and more like Metro on steroids.. don’t panic, it’s not you. When your gun jams, your stomach growls, or you stumble upon those cursed Bloodsuckers, all sense of hope and joy just evaporates. It’s like the Zone itself whispers, “Boi this is not Metro, welcome to misery.”\r\nAnother curious thing is, not offering a pre-load for a game that's over 150 gigs? That's pure chaos. It's like asking someone to fill a swimming pool with a teaspoon and then wondering why it’s taking so long.\r\nIn short, Stalker 2 looks way better than I expected (if you ignore the optimization that’s held together by duct tape and prayers) I can already see myself pouring at least 100 hours into this radioactive masterpiece, kissing 2024 goodbye in the Zone, and enduring at least 23 crashes along the way.\r\n\r\nGood hunting, Stalker.",

        "review": "Stalker 2's Missed Opportunities: A Critical Look at Visual Clarity, Accessibility, and A-Life\n\nThe long-awaited release of Stalker 2, powered by Unreal Engine 5, has sparked excitement across the gaming community. However, for all its technical advancements and graphical ambitions, the game falls short in critical areas that are integral to the Stalker experience. From its over-reliance on upscalers to issues with accessibility and the apparent absence of a fully-functional \"A-Life\" system, Stalker 2 feels like a visually stunning, but thematically disjointed, entry in the series.\n\n1. Over-Reliance on Upscalers: A Threat to Visual Clarity\n\nWhile upscaling technologies like DLSS and FSR have become popular tools for maintaining performance in graphically demanding games, Stalker 2 relies on them to the detriment of visual clarity. Beyond 20 meters, environments lack the sharpness and fidelity that fans of the series expect. The dense, immersive world of the Zone—once alive with intricate details and subtle cues—is now smoothed over by aggressive upscaling artifacts, making distant objects appear muddy or poorly defined.\n\nFor a game that thrives on exploration and environmental storytelling, this is a significant misstep. Players rely on visual detail to navigate the Zone and identify threats, and the current implementation hinders their ability to fully engage with the game world.\n\n2. Motion Blur and Anti-Aliasing: A Barrier to Accessibility\n\nThe anti-aliasing techniques employed in Stalker 2 introduce pervasive motion blur, especially during fast-paced sequences or even simple camera movements. While AA is essential for reducing jagged edges, its implementation here creates a visual effect that can be headache-inducing and disorienting for many players. For a game that demands quick reflexes and spatial awareness, this is more than a minor inconvenience—it becomes an accessibility issue.\n\nDevelopers should prioritize options that allow players to adjust or disable such effects, ensuring a wider audience can enjoy the game without discomfort. The lack of these features at launch is a glaring oversight.\n\n3. The Absence of Functional A-Life: A Core Element Missing\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Stalker series is its \"A-Life\" system, a groundbreaking AI simulation that brings the Zone to life. A-Life populates the world with dynamic, unscripted encounters, creating a sense of unpredictability and realism that few games can replicate. In Stalker 2, however, this system appears to be severely compromised—or missing altogether.\n\nThis becomes particularly evident when players reload quicksaves. Hotspots generate entirely new encounters with each reload, revealing a system that relies on static spawning rather than a persistent simulation. This not only breaks immersion but also undermines the very essence of what makes Stalker unique. A-Life isn’t just a feature; it’s the soul of the series. Its absence feels like a betrayal to long-time fans who expected the next evolution of this iconic mechanic.\n\n4. A Call for Better Optimization and Design Choices\n\nWhile technical challenges are understandable in modern game development, the issues present in Stalker 2 are indicative of misplaced priorities. Instead of relying so heavily on upscalers, developers should focus on optimizing native rendering for clearer visuals. Accessibility features such as customizable motion blur and AA settings should be non-negotiable in a game with such a vast and diverse audience. Most importantly, A-Life must return in its full glory to preserve the authenticity of the Stalker experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nStalker 2 is an ambitious title, but ambition alone cannot compensate for shortcomings in execution. By addressing these issues—enhancing visual clarity, improving accessibility, and reinstating a functional A-Life system—developers can transform Stalker 2 into the masterpiece it has the potential to be. Fans of the series deserve no less. The Zone is waiting; let’s hope the developers are listening.",

        "review": "A very early review and a warning for anyone with accessibility needs that REQUIRE the use of key rebinding (Like myself)\n\nThe key rebinding system at the point of release is half baked at best. Whilst it allows for rebinding it doesn't cover 100% of the use cases. \n\nFor example, the lamp quick access control is L and is not rebind-able. I rebind my left movement key to L doing so works you move left, but you also toggle your lamp on and off. Another issue which you run into very early in the game is ladders. Ladder actions are not rebound to your new movement keys. Definitely feels like the devs added the ability but nobody every did a play through doing so. \n\nThis is a huge disappointment to someone like myself who has been very excited for the release of this game and make its very difficult for me to play. \n\nAdditional points. The optimisation of the game really is as bad as the early reviewers say. I am running a 4070ti with the latest drivers and I have it on medium settings with DLSS on and I am wildly bouncing between 50 - 80 fps which feels AWFUL. Not had a proper play around with the settings yet as I wanted to get stuck into the game and I am sure I can make tweaks, but would of been nice if the auto detect settings had worked and not just put everything on epic. \n\nOverall I am really initially disappointed and I hope to update this review shortly as updates and patches role out, but for now I cant recommend it, based on my own experiences.",

Whether this is due to frame latency or just wonky camera controls, I have no clue.\n\n[h3]A-Life 2.0[/h3]\n\nThe thing that made previous S.T.A.L.K.E.R. titles so great is the immersive A-Life system which simulates other AI stalkers, mutants and events. This feature is either completly broken or simply has not been added. At the moment AI pops in when close to you, which is not at all how it used to work, in older titles the world felt more alive and I cannot remember a single instance of pop-in like with the current implementation.\n\n[h3]Just wait[/h3]\n\nAnyways I'd recommend waiting until these issues have been resolved, if you play it now you'll probably regret it later since this is simply not the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience I and many others hoped for. I also don't understand why'd they go for graphics that rival real life, if they'd release a game that looks like damn Garry's Mod but with updated gameplay systems then I'd bet a lot of people would be happier right now. \n\nWait and see I guess, GSC is good at patching so they've got that going for them.\n\n[h3]Edit[/h3]\n\nI keep getting messages about how they had to develop this during the war in Ukraine, which is valid and obviously a terrible situation. Of course I did factor this into my initial expectations yet I still feel like it shouldn't give them a carte blanche and make me overlook some of the points I described before this.\n\nAs I mentioned before this, I don't think this is 0/10 experience, the bones are there and I really believe that they can turn this into a GOTY-tier game but at the current moment it just lacks in various areas.",

Neither the gpu or cpu are at full usage so I don't think that throttling is at play here granted my cpu isn't exactly the best there is but I don't think that it's the issue.

When I look at the map, I can clearly see the areas from the old games, and I can see that the map is fully interconnected. No loading screens. What I wanted Call of Chernobyl to be in an ideal world.\r\n\r\nThey added more hazards, like swarms of mutated rats (Not Tushcanos, actual rats). And the atmosphere is still pretty good though it doesn't match what the X-Ray engine could do with Atmosfear.\r\n\r\nBut then there's a couple of negatives. Combat feels off. You can't manually lean around corners, your character has to lean for you if you aim near a corner. As far as I could tell there was no way to set custom keybinds. Because of this, you're going to have to push at weird angles and play more agressively, which means you're going to get hit more, so even with a leather jacket your character is pretty durable and just soaks hits.\r\n\r\nMutants are a lot harder to dodge, I'm fairly certain you can't dodge Bloodsuckers, and they take a lot more ammo to kill. You can't skin mutants for parts either so killing mutants is just a waste of ammo.\r\n\r\nThe bestiary and anomaly catalog are gone. The Stalker rankings are gone. The ingame achievment system from Pripyat is gone, you know, the one that actually also rewarded you with ingame mechanical changes for getting them.\r\n\r\nA lot of the RPG mechanics are watered down, so, as far as I've played, I've for example not found medication that temporarily increases resistance to something. You won't find meds that increase your resistance to radiation for when you need to go through a radiation field that your armor+artifact setup can't soak. And so far I haven't come across a single emission, so I don't even know if artifacts respawn.\r\n\r\nBut I could forgive all that.\r\n\r\nWhat I can't forgive is how unoptimized the game is when its charging 60 euros for the base game, 80 euros for a quest and extra equipment (which ruins loot progression),and 110 euros for an exosuit at the start of the game, a paywalled quest and a season pass.\r\n\r\nIts not my system, either. Its the game failing to load assets or to purge assets. Sometimes the game will just randomly start locking up massively and if I just quicksave while this is happening and reload, forcing it to reload everything, it is magically fixed.\r\n\r\nI expected jank. That's a feature of Stalker, even if we're not on X-Ray anymore. But sometimes the game is straight up unplayable.\r\n\r\nAlso, stealth is completely broken, so enemies will see you through terrain/walls which means you can't get the drop on them and have to start 1v3+ fights on the backfoot.",

You can lean manually whenever you want by pressing Z and C.\n2. We have medications in the game, that gives you temporary boost. You probably didn't see them, because you're still in the beginning of the game. For example, Barvinok, Hercules, PSI-Blocators, etc. Don't hesitate to use them, because they really do help.\n3. You can perform stealth kills, but yes, it is very hard and challenging to annihilate the whole squad in the building by stealth only. \n\nAs for other things mentioned — there are definitely things we can, and we will work on to improve. The Zone hasn't welcomed you in her best state, but be sure that with patches and fixes it will become a better place.\n\nBy the way, please, if you encounter anymore “anomalies” that are not supposed to be in the Zone — report them to our Technical Support Hub. That will help us investigate your case and implement fixes faster:\n\nhttps://support.stalker2.com/hc/en-us/requests/new"

Because it really feels like stalker 2 when you play it. If you like me enjoyed the previous stalker games, you will enjoy this one. \n\nIf you are new and don't know if it's for you, then I will try to do my best to explain it. \nIt's a bit like fallout 3, but really gritty and hard. Stalker 2 goes for a more realistic approach and is in turn really difficult at times. You will need to maintain hunger, thirst, radioactive poisoning, bleeding and your gear and no one is your friend.  \n\nFew clip notes:\nI had one crash when I died to an anomaly in an abandoned ship.  \nThe poppy fields was awesome! I wish they had made it even more scary. \nI wish they would remove the death counter. \nThe English voice acting isn't that great. \nThe gun-play is really good. \nI feel like I am in the zone and the zone hates me\n\nFor those that needs it translated to numbers: 8/10\n\nHappy hunting Stalker.",
